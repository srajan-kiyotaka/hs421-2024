    "# Models of Binary Dependent Variable \n",

    "- The materials in this notebook is prepared using Scott Long's \"Regression models for categorical and Limited dependent variables\".The figure posted in the notes are sourced from this book.\n",
    "- Kindly refrain from quoting, as I haven't included citations for all the textbooks/paper I referenced in the preparation of these notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary dependent variable models are utilized when outcomes or responses are discrete, typically taking values of 1 or 0. Examples include decisions such as whether to take a job or not, whether to pursue higher studies, and similar scenarios. These models are particularly suited for situations where the outcome can be categorized into two distinct groups.\n",

    "## The Linear Probability Model (LPM) \n",
    "When employing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to estimate parameters in the context of a binary or dummy variable as the dependent variable, the resultant regression is referred to as the Linear Probability Model (LPM). In the LPM, the dependent variable is binary, signifying outcomes such as the presence or absence of a particular event. For instance, this could encompass scenarios where the event of interest either happens or does not occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be expressed as $$y=X\\beta +\\varepsilon,$$ where $E(y|X)=X\\beta$. \n",
    "For instance, suppose we aim to investigate the determinants of whether a woman is engaged in paid employment or not. In this case, the Linear Probability Model (LPM) can be specifically formulated as follows:  $$y_i=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}x_{1i}+...+\\beta_{k}x_{ki},$$ where, $\\beta$s are the parameters of interest and $x_i$s are the independent variables and  $y_{i}$ is defined as:$$\n",
    "y_{i}=\\left\\{ \n",
    "\\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "1-\\text{if  ith woman is in paid employment} \\\\ \n",
    "0-\\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\\right. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it is linear probability model?\n",
    "To comprehend why this model is termed the Linear Probability Model (LPM), it's essential to delve into the concepts of unconditional and conditional expectations of the dependent variable $y_{i}$. \n",
    "The unconditional expectation of $y_{i}$, denoted as $E(y_{i})$, is computed by summing the probabilities of $y_{i}$ taking the value 1 or 0, weighted by their respective occurrences. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(y_{i})=[1\\times P(y_{i}=1)]+[0\\times P(y_{i}=0)]=P(y_{i}=1).$$ Similarly, the conditional expectation of $y_{i}$ given $x_{i}$, denoted as $E(y_{i}|x_{i})$, involves calculating the probabilities of $y_{i}$ being 1 or 0 given the values of $x_{i}$, and summing them up. $$E(y_{i}|x_{i})=[1\\times P(y_{i}=1|x_{i})]+[0\\times P(y_{i}=0|x_{i})]=P(y_{i}=1|x_{i})$$. Hence, $E(y_{i}|x_{i})=\\alpha +\\beta x_{i}=P(y_{i}=1|x_{i})=P_{i}$, where $\\beta$ represents the expected change in the probability of being in paid employment due to a one-unit change in $x_{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, $E(y_{i}|x_{i})$ provides the probability of the occurrence of the event of interest, given the specific conditions or characteristics denoted by $x_{i}$. In the context of analyzing whether a woman is engaged in paid employment, $E(y_{i}|x_{i})$ signifies the likelihood of being in paid employment based on the particular attributes represented by $x_{i}$. Therefore, the name LPM\n",
    "\n",
    "In matrix notation, the Linear Probability Model (LPM) can be represented as $E(y|X)=X\\beta =P$, where $y$ is a vector containing $n$ observations, and $X$ is the matrix of independent variables as defined in the previously circulated notes. Each element $\\beta_{k}$ in the coefficient vector $\\beta$ quantifies the expected change in the probability of the event occurring due to a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable $x_{k}$, with all other variables held constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notable characteristic of the LPM is that a unit change in any independent variable $x_{k}$ consistently leads to the same change in the probability, regardless of the specific variable being altered. This uniform relationship between changes in the independent variables and alterations in the probability of the event occurring gives rise to the term 'Linear Probability Model'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of LPM\n",
    "However, the LPM has its limitations. One significant issue pertains to the properties of errors. The errors $\\varepsilon _{i}$ can take two values based on the outcome $y_{i}$, leading to non-normal distributions and heteroskedasticity. i.e:\n",
    "$$\\varepsilon _{i}=\\left\\{ \n",
    "\\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "1-X\\beta \\text{ if }y_{i}=1\\text{ with probability }P_{i} \\\\ \n",
    "-X\\beta \\text{ if }y_{i}=0\\text{ with probability }1-P_{i}\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\\right. $$\n",
    "and the expection and variance of errors  can be derived as follows:\n",
    "$$E(\\varepsilon|X)=P(1-X\\beta )+(1-P)(-X\\beta\n",
    ") ,$$ substituting  $P=X\\beta $ we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(\\varepsilon|X)=0$$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{var}(\\varepsilon|X) &= P(1-X\\beta)^{2} + (1-P)(-X\\beta)^{2} \\\\\n",
    "&= X\\beta (1-X\\beta)^{2} + (1-X\\beta)(-X\\beta)^{2} \\\\\n",
    "&= X\\beta (1-X\\beta)\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "Since $\\text{var}(\\varepsilon|X) $ depends on X, its heteroschedastic. Hence, std. errors are biased and OLS is inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the interpretation of coefficients in the LPM may not always align with expectations, as the assumption of linearity in probability can be unrealistic in certain contexts. Also, $E(y|X)=X\\beta $ is interpreted as probabilities and in many cases $X\\beta $ lie outside the interval (0,1)."

    "#  Latent variable intrepretation \n",
    "\n",
    "In the scenario outlined above, consider an individual's labour force participation as the observed $y$. The variable $y$ can only be observed in two states: an individual is in the labour force or she is not. However, not all  in the labor force are there with the same certainty. One individual may be very close to the decision of leaving the labour force, while another individual could be very firm on her decision. In both cases, we observe the same $y=1$. The idea of a latent $y^*$ is that there is an underlying propensity to work that generates the observed state. While we cannot directly observe $y^*$ , at some point a change in $y^*$  results in a change in what we observe, namely whether an individual is in the labor force. To clarify, let's assume that individual $i$ has an expected wage (reservation wage), and they decide to enter employment if the market wage exceeds this expectation. Let $w_i$ represent the market wage, and $w_i^*$. Then the latent variable $y_i^*$ can be expressed as follows: \n",
