    "#### Example for Omitted variable bias: Is coffe good for health? (reproduced from Stock and Watson pp 214)\n",
    " \n",
    "A study published in the Medicine (Gunter, Murphy, Cross, et al. 2017) Annals of Internal suggested that drinking coffee is linked to a lower risk of disease or death. This study was based on examining 521,330 participants for a mean period of 16 years in 10 European countries. From this sample group, 41,693 deaths were recorded during this period. Another recent study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (Loftfield, Cornelis, Caporaso, et al. 2018) investigated the link between heavy intake of coffee and risk of mortality. It suggested that drinking six–seven cups of coffee per day was associated with a 16% lower risk of death. This study attracted substantial attention in the U.K. press, with articles bearing headlines such as “Six coffees a day could save your life” and “Have another cup of coffee! Six cups a day could decrease your risk of early death by up to 16%, National Cancer Institute study finds.” Are these headlines accurate? Perhaps not. While they suggest a causal relationship between coffee and life expectancy, there is the potential for omitted variable bias to influence the relationship being established. Reviews of this study, including those by the United Kingdom’s National Health Service (NHS) and the BMJ, note that some people may opt not to drink coffee if they know they have an illness already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, coffee can be considered as a surrogate endpoint for factors that affect health—income, education, or deprivation—that may confound the observed beneficial associations and introduce errors. According to a paper published in BMJ (Poole, Kennedy, Roderick, et al. 2017), randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or randomized controlled experiments, allow for many of these errors to be removed. In this case, removing the ability of people to select if they should drink coffee and how much they should consume would remove any omitted variable bias arising from differences in income or in expectations about\n",
    "health among coffee drinkers and non-coffee drinkers. Sometimes, however, there may be neither a genuine relationship that an RCT could detect, nor even an omitted variable responsible for the relationship. The website “Spurious Correlations” details many such examples. For instance, the per capita consumption of mozzarella cheese over time  hows a strong, and coincidental, relationship with the award of civil engineering doctorates. Be careful when interpreting the results of regressions!(We will revisit this later in detail)\n",
